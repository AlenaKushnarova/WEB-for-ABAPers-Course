            <h1>Homework</h1>
            <p>Homework is usually given to students by the teachers.
                It is a practice work which helps students revise on what
                they've learned that day. Homework also helps students
                to remember what they learned. Many students will get more
                homework and some will get less. This depends on how old they are,
                what grade/primary/year they are in and how smart/intelligent they
                are. This could determine what level they are in. Most students
                say that homework is a waste of time and that they do enough work
                at school; however, it is also believed that homework is very
                important for a student as it can help in their exams and education.
                Other students say other homework is helpful.</p>
